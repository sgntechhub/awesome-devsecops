# COMMANDS 

- `kubectl cluster-info` - view the cluster details
- `kubectl create deployment` - Deploy an app
- `kubectl exec $POD_NAME env` - list the environment variables

- `kubectl proxy` - create a proxy that will forward communications into the cluster-wide, private network.
- `kubectl get` - list resources
	- `kubectl get nodes` - view the nodes in the cluster
	- `kubectl get pods` - view the pods in the node 
	- `kubectl get deployments` - list your deployments

- `kubectl describe` - show detailed information about a resource
- `kubectl logs` - print the logs from a container in a pod
- `kubectl exec`- execute a command on a container in a pod
	- `kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME bash` - start a bash session in the Podâ€™s container
- `kubectl delete service` - delete Services

## Expose your app publicly
- ClusterIP (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.
- NodePort - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>. Superset of ClusterIP.
- LoadBalancer - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.
- ExternalName - Exposes the Service using an arbitrary name (specified by externalName in the spec) by returning a CNAME record with the name. No proxy is used. This type requires v1.7 or higher of kube-dns.

## Scaling an application

> Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a Deployment. (up or down)

- `kubectl scale` - Followed by the deployment type, name and desired number of instances
- Exp: scale the Deployment to 4 replicas `kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4`

## Rolling Updates

> Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones.

- Rolling updates allow the following actions:
    - Promote an application from one environment to another (via container image updates)
    - Rollback to previous versions
    - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of applications with zero downtime
    
1. Update the version of the app

- `kubectl set image` - to update the image of the application to a version. followed by the deployment name and the new image version
- Exp: `kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2`
- `kubectl rollout status` - confirm rollout status 

2. Rollback an update 

- `kubectl rollout undo` - revert the deployment to the previous known state. Alternatively, you can rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with --to-revision
